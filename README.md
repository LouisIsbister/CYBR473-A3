# C473-A3

### Introduction
This repository is used to keep track of my submission for the final CYBR473 assignment, with the goal of this assignment being to develop a proof-of-concept "toy" malware. 

### How to Run/Test:
1) Navigate to the `server` directory and execute the `server.py` file.
2) Open a new command prompt and run `controller.py` aslo from `server`.
3) Open another command prompt, go to the `src` directory and run the make file. For me that is `mingW32-make` but yours may be different.
4) Once compiled run the generated executable `.\run.exe`. This should immediately start sending requests to the server, you can go back to your `controller` window and start executing commands to the client!
